# HousePricePredictMLProject
# Project Goal :
The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features such as size, location, and other property attributes. The model aims to provide accurate predictions to assist in real estate decision-making and market analysis.

# Understand the USA Real Estate Dataset
brokered by (categorically encoded agency/broker)
status (Housing status - a. ready for sale or b. ready to build)
price (Housing price, it is either the current listing price or recently * sold price if the house is sold recently)
bed (# of beds)
bath (# of bathrooms)
acre_lot (Property / Land size in acres)
street (categorically encoded street address)
city (city name)
state (state name)
zip_code (postal code of the area)
house_size (house area/size/living space in square feet)
prev_sold_date (Previously sold date)
NB:
brokered by and street addresses were categorically encoded due to data privacy policy
acre_lot means the total land area, and house_size denotes the living space/building area
